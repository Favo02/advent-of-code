# Advent of code
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, resolved using golang


> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## File naming convention:
`challenge.go`: clean solution with comments

`challenge_original.go`: first solution writter, the one that calculated the result to submit

`challege_bruteforce.go`: inefficient algorithms written to test efficiency

`easyInput.txt`: input used in examples

`input.txt`: input to compute the result on

`input2.txt`: another input to test the result (usually from a smurf account or from a friend) (inputs are not the same for every user)

## Commit convention:
`YEAR-DAY: working`: usually first solution for the YEAR - DAY challenge

`YEAR-DAY: refactor`: refactor of the clean solution or refactor of the comments

`YEAR-DAY: add input`: add a test input for the YEAR - DAY challenge

`repo: ...`: adjustments to the repository (not challenge related)

## Pull request convention:
I usually create a new branch (`YEAR-DAY`) for every challenge (so for every day) and I merge (sending a PR) when it works or whenever I think it is time to merge
