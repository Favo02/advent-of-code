# What is advent of code
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, resolved using golang

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

# Conventions

## Why I don't include input files:
AoC creator asked to not share input files (in [this tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081) and in the [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/puzzle_texts/)), so I do not include them into my repo.

You can still run every challenge with your input, available at [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), after login (input is unique for every user).

## File naming convention:
`challenge.go`: clean solution with comments

`challenge_original.go`: first solution writter, the one that calculated the result to submit

`challege_bruteforce.go`: inefficient algorithms written to test efficiency

`easyInput.txt`: input used in examples

`input.txt`: input to compute the result on

`input2.txt`: another input to test the result (usually from a smurf account or from a friend) (inputs are not the same for every user)

## Commit convention:
`YEAR-DAY: working`: usually first solution for the YEAR - DAY challenge

`YEAR-DAY: refactor`: refactor of the clean solution or refactor of the comments

`YEAR-DAY: add input`: add a test input for the YEAR - DAY challenge

`repo: ...`: adjustments to the repository (not challenge related)

## Pull request convention:
I usually create a new branch (`YEAR-DAY`) for every challenge (so for every day) and I merge (sending a PR) when it works or whenever I think it is time to merge
