## Conventions

### Why I don't include input files:

AoC creator asked to not share input files (in [this tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081) and in the [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/puzzle_texts/)), so I do not include them into my repo.

You can still run every challenge with your input, available at [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), after login (input is unique for every user).

### Content of the repo:

- `<year>/day<day>/day<day>.*`: clean and refactored solution
- `<year>/day<day>/day<day>_part*_original.*`: solution written as fast as possible _(impossible to read and almost always inefficient)_
- `<year>/day<day>/day<day>_bruteforce.*`: bruteforce or other approaches to test efficiency
